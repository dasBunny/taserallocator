# Taserallocator

## Usage
After installing the plugin currently only offers one option for the player
- ``!taser`` toggles the taser drop on or off for the player


## Installation
Install just like any other SourceMod plugin by dropping the taserallocator.smx file into your /csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/ folder


## Disclaimer
This was a little fun project, I know it has some shady edges to it. I cannot guarantee that it will run stable on any plattform, use at your own risk. 


## License
Feel free to use this as you please. Credit would be nice, but I do not expect it for this simple plugin.
